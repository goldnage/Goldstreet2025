Installation Steps
Navigate to the libdaq directory: Assuming you have already cloned the repository using git clone https://github.com/snort3/libdaq.git, navigate into the directory where the source code is located.
bash
cd libdaq
Generate configuration scripts: Run the bootstrap script to generate the necessary configuration files. This step requires autoconf and libtool (which are included in the prerequisites).
bash
./bootstrap
Configure the build: Run the ./configure script to prepare the source code for your specific system. It's generally recommended not to use a --prefix here to avoid potential issues with the Snort 3 build process later.
bash
./configure
Compile the source code: Use the make command to compile the library.
bash
make
Install the library: Install the compiled library and its files into the system directories. This usually requires superuser privileges.
bash
sudo make install
Update shared libraries: Run sudo ldconfig to update the system's shared library cache, ensuring that the newly installed libdaq is found by other programs (like Snort 3).
bash
sudo ldconfig
 
The libdaq library is now installed and ready for the main Snort 3 installation.
